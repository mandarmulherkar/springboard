This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
flower = read.csv("flower.csv", header = FALSE)
str(flower)
flowerMatrix = as.matrix(flower)
str(flowerMatrix)

flowerVector = as.vector(flowerMatrix)
str(flowerVector)

flowerVector2 = as.vector(flower)
str(flowerVector2)
```

```{r}
# Distances

distance = dist(flowerVector, method = "euclidean")
clusterIntensity = hclust(distance, method = "ward")
plot(clusterIntensity)

# Determine clusters.
rect.hclust(clusterIntensity, 3, border="red")
flowerClusters = cutree(clusterIntensity, k=3)
flowerClusters
tapply(flowerVector, flowerClusters, mean)
```

```{r}
# Output the image
dim(flowerClusters) = c(50, 50)

# Segmented image
image(flowerClusters, axes = FALSE)

# Original Image.
image(flowerMatrix, axes = FALSE, col = grey(seq(0, 1, length=256)))
```
