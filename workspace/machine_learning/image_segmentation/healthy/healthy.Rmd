```{r}
# Read the healthy data set.

healthy = read.csv("healthy.csv", header = FALSE)
healthyMatrix = as.matrix(healthy)
str(healthyMatrix)
```
```{r}
# Display the image.
image(healthyMatrix, axes = FALSE, col = grey(seq(0, 1, length = 256)))
```
```{r}
# Hierarchical clustering
healthyVector = as.vector(healthyMatrix)
# The image is too high res, distances are n * (n - 1) / 2 for about 365K points.
# distance = dist(healthyVector, method = "euclidean")
```

```{r}
k = 5
set.seed(1)
KMC = kmeans(healthyVector, centers = k, iter.max = 1000)
str(KMC)
healthyClusters = KMC$cluster
KMC$centers[2]

# Output a colored image.
dim(healthyClusters) = c(nrow(healthyMatrix), ncol(healthyMatrix))
image(healthyClusters, axes = FALSE, col = rainbow(k))
```

```{r}
# Read the tumor file.
tumor = read.csv("tumor.csv", header = FALSE)

```{r}

```{r}
